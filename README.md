This project builds a self-driving RC car using Raspberry Pi, Arduino and open source software. Raspberry Pi collects inputs from a camera module and an ultrasonic sensor, and sends data to a computer wirelessly. The computer processes input images and sensor data for object detection (stop sign and traffic light) and collision avoidance respectively. A neural network model runs on computer and makes predictions for steering based on input images. Predictions are then sent to the Arduino for RC car control.
